Stack Overflow for Opinionated System Design

### General Idea
- Questions are not open format but asked with prompts
  - What is the problem, situation, background, goal?
  - What are the requirements
  - What are the tools you plan to use
  - What is you proposed solution
- Rating / Feedback System
  - Instead of up down, there is a 0 to 6+ scale
  - Don’t ask “best architecture”, but “can this be implemented and maintained in a reasonable fashion
  - 0 = This is copy and pasted homework. Provide more info and propose a solution
  - 1 = This could have major security, regulatory, cost issues. Do not implement this solution
  - 2 = Technically doable but would require lots of custom work, patching systems together, etc
